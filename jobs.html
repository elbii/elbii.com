  Our garage office is located in the heart of downtown Mountain View just a few
  blocks from Caltrain and VTA stops. We regularly attend Bay Area Meetups and
  host backyard hacker BBQs over interesting discussions and great beer.
</p>

  We're always looking for smart folks who get things done. We especially like
  people who take an engineering approach to any given task:
  <ol>
    <li><b>Define</b> the problem</li>
    <li><b>Explore</b> the solution space</li>
    <li><b>Design</b> the solution</li>
    <li><b>Implement</b> the solution</li>
    <li><b>Incorporate</b> feedback</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h4>We love things that rock.</h4>
<p>
  At Elbii we use the latest open source technologies available. If it's not
  around, we contribute or write our own. And our taste in gnarly stuff is not just
  limited to engineering. We like this stuff too:
  <ul>
    <li>Profitability</li>
    <li>Uncapped Bonuses</li>
    <li>Great coffee</li>
    <li>30" monitors</li>
    <li>The Unix Philosophy</li>
    <li>Company Retreats</li>
    <li>Nginx</li>
    <li>Rails</li>
    <li>Test-driven Development</li>
    <li>Continuous Integration</li>
  </ul>
</p>

  If any of this sounds sexy to you, definitely give us a call at any reasonable
  hour (PST). Our number is (650) 735-2448.
