      We're based in SoMa, San Francisco but embrace working with folks from around the
      globe. We take on a variety of interesting projects and offer flexible
      working hours.

      We're always looking for smart people who get things done. It doesn't
      really matter too much where you're located as long you do a good job.
      Good communication is the #1 skill we look for in all candidates. And we
      especially like people who take an engineering approach to any given task:
    </p>

      <ol>
        <li><b>Define</b> the problem</li>
        <li><b>Explore</b> the solution space</li>
        <li><b>Design</b> the solution</li>
        <li><b>Implement</b> the solution</li>
        <li><b>Incorporate</b> feedback</li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <h4>We love things that rock.</h4>
    <p>
      At Elbii we use the latest open source technologies available. If it's not
      around, we contribute or write our own. And our taste in gnarly stuff is not just
      limited to engineering. We like this stuff too:
      <ul>
        <li>Profitability</li>
        <li>Uncapped Bonuses</li>
        <li>The Unix Philosophy</li>
        <li>Huge Monitors</li>
        <li>Gourmet Coffee</li>
        <li>Company Trips</li>
        <li>Cryptocurrencies</li>
        <li>W3C and Web Standards Groups</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
