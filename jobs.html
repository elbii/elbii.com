<h1>The most productive place you'll work.</h1>

<p class="lead">
  We're a young, energetic team of analytically-minded folks obsessed
  with focused, creative productivity. Elbii offers competitive pay and a
  workspace stipend to spend however you like. You'll get to pick which
  projects to work on and enjoy a flat hierarchical structure that promotes
  individualism over corporate homogeneity.

  Our garage office is located in the heart of downtown Mountain View just a few
  blocks from Caltrain and VTA stops. When we're feeling adventurous you may
  even spot us at one of the nearby coffee shops. We regularly attend
  Bay Area Meetups and host backyard hacker BBQs over interesting discussions
  and great beer.
</p>

  We're always looking for smart folks who get things done. We especially like
  people who take an engineering approach to any given task:
  <ol>
    <li><b>Define</b> the problem</li>
    <li><b>Explore</b> the solution space</li>
    <li><b>Design</b> the solution</li>
    <li><b>Implement</b> the solution</li>
    <li><b>Incorporate</b> feedback</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<h4>We love things that rock.</h4>
<p>
  At Elbii we use the latest open source technologies available. If it's not
  around, we contribute or write our own. Our taste in gnarly stuff is not just
  limited to engineering, however:
  <ul>
    <li>Node</li>
    <li>Profitability</li>
    <li>Uncapped Bonuses</li>
    <li>MongoDB</li>
    <li>ElasticSearch</li>
    <li>PostgreSQL</li>
    <li>Great coffee</li>
    <li>30" monitors</li>
    <li>The Unix Philosophy</li>
    <li>BackboneJS</li>
    <li>Websockets</li>

  </ul>
