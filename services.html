<h1>Two-Week MVP</h1>
<p class="lead">
  For a fixed negotiated cost, we'll build the MVP for any web application idea
  in two weeks or less. Or give you a full refund.
</p>

<p class="two-column">
  Developing even a <em>beta</em> version of your idea before you've tested its
  viability is like flushing money down the toilet with the hopes you'll be
  able to retrieve it sometime later at the sewage treatment facility. Even
  worse, you've likely lost months of development time with little to show for
  it. Please, give us a call or shoot us an email before you decide to do that.
  We'll be happy to give you a free first consultation.

<h1>HTML5 / CSS3 Mobile Web Application</h1>
<p class="lead">
  Stop treating mobile users like peons who just happen to be using your product
  on the go. Let us build you a highly-tuned mobile web application that makes
  them first-class citizens of your product or service.
</p>

<p class="two-column">
  With the introduction of HTML5, CSS3, and modern Javascript engines has come
  a new, more efficient philosophy for web application development. Modern
  mobile web applications can now perform on par with and be as feature-rich as
  their native application counterparts at a fraction of the development and
  maintenance cost. Call or email us to set up a free consultation.
