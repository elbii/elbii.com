    <h5>Why should you care about security?</h5>
    <p>
      Let's put it this way. It's 2014. We live in an age of government backdoors, rampant privacy abuse, and user database leaks nearly everyday. If you don't make user privacy and security a priority, you will eventually get hacked, your users will be pissed, and they'll look to your competitors for services they can trust.

    <h5>What's considered "secure"?</h5>
    <p>
      Your users should be confident their information is safe with you. Today, this means using HTTPS everywhere (perhaps with independently verified certificate signatures), dedicated servers, encrypted storage, 2-factor authentication, and strong password policies. Guess what? We have experience implementing all of that stuff. Don't make the all-too-common mistake of trying to <a href='http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/18197/why-shouldnt-we-roll-our-own'>build your own</a>.

    <h5>Implementation Details</h5>
    <p>
      We're skilled in the web's most popular development languages and frameworks: <strong>Node.JS, Ruby on Rails, and Python / Django</strong>. We practice continuous integration and aim for a 2:1 test:code ratio. We document everything we do and automate the repetitive stuff to be as efficient as possible. Needless to say, we're addicted to productivity hacks.

    <h5>Payment</h5>
    <p>
      Our payment terms are pretty flexible. Generally we prefer to bill by the day -- this makes invoices simpler and straightforward for both parties. If there's another billing method you'd like just ask us. Oh, we also accept Bitcoin through <a href='https://bitpay.com'>Bitpay</a>. We hate dealing with lawyers more than you know, so we'll give it our best shot to gracefully handle any payment conflicts that may arise.
