<h1>Two-Week MVP</h1>
<p class="lead">
  For a fixed negotiated cost, we'll build the MVP for any web application idea
  in two weeks or less. Or give you a full refund.
</p>

<p class="two-column">
  Developing even a <em>beta</em> version of your idea before you've tested its
  viability is like flushing money down the toilet with the hopes you'll be
  able to retrieve it sometime later at the sewage treatment facility. Even
  worse, you've likely lost months of development time with little to show for
  it. Please, give us a call or shoot us an email before you decide to do that.
  We'll be happy to give you a free first consultation.
