  We strongly support online privacy, care deeply about web security, and are a little obsessed with software engineering best practices.
</p>

<p>
  Let's put it this way. It's 2014. We live in an age of government backdoors, rampant privacy abuse, and user database leaks nearly everyday. If you don't make user privacy and web security a priority, you will eventually get hacked, your users will be pissed, and they'll look to your competitors for services they can trust.
</p>

<p>
  Your users should be confident their information is safe with you. Today, this means using HTTPS everywhere (perhaps with independently verified certificate signatures), dedicated servers, encrypted storage, 2-factor authentication, and strong password policies. Guess what? We have experience implementing all of the above. Don't try to do it yourself and fail. Let us handle it for you.
</p>

<p>
  We're skilled in the web's most popular development languages and frameworks: Node.JS, Ruby on Rails, and Python / Django. We practice continuous integration and generally aim for a 2:1 test:code ratio. We document everything we do. We try to automate everything so things are as efficient as possible. Needless to say, when our work's complete, you won't have any of those pesky, lingering code "handoff" issues.

<p>
  We hate dealing with lawyers more than you know, so we'll give it our best shot to gracefully handle any conflicts that may arise. Our payment terms are pretty flexible. Our goal is to provide an outstanding value to your business. And we're proud to accept Bitcoin!
