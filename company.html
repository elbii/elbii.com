<h1>Our story</h1>

    <p>
      Elbii started out of a small garage office in downtown Mountain View in 2013. Armed with a used beer fridge, free couch off craigslist, and a couple laptops, the three of us set out to see if anyone would be interested in what we could build together. Well, it turns out a few folks did.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      After a few months we eventually grew out of the garage -- not into a real office -- but into a fully remote team. We're big advocates of working remotely -- it boosts our productivity, prevents burnout, and leads to more inspirating work.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      These days we enjoy working on projects emphasizing privacy and security to support the idea of a free, open Internet for everyone.
