  From Completely Broke to Successful Consultant in a Year
</h1>
<p><small>Nov 27, 2012 by <a href="https://github.com/jamillion" target="_blank">jamil</a></small></p>

<p> A few of you have been asking how I got to the point where I'm at now --
doing what I love every day. Well, to understand how Elbii was started and came
to be the successful vehicle of happiness it is, I feel that a bit of story time
is appropriate. </p>

<p> It was October of 2010. I had graduated that May, spent the summer enjoying
my last few moments of young naive freedom traveling abroad, and was back home
and broke. Although well rested, stress was building quickly. I knew I needed to
find some income and find it fast. I also knew that, as a software engineer,
Silicon Valley was my Mecca. I could hear it beckoning to me... <em>Move here
and all your dreams will come true</em>. But in reality, I didn't even have
enough money to make it halfway, let alone enough to move in, sign a lease, and
begin job hunting. So what did I do? The same thing every broke recent-grad does
when he hits that "Yikes I'm unemployedl" moment. I sold my textbooks, netting
about $1500. I then used this money to scrape by for the next month while
I tried to land some local consulting gigs. </p>

<p> My student loan repayment deadline was approaching fast, but unfortunately
my clients were not. With my measly reserves dwindling fast, it was finally time
to start accepting the fact that I was going to have to suck it up and wade into
the smelly swamp of corporate desk jobs. So I made a pot of coffee, locked
myself in the batcave, and cranked out profiles on every job website I could
find. Surely, someone will notice I finished a 4-year engineering degree from
a respectable university and shove their way to the front of the line to hire
me! I mean I just paid $100k for 4 years of brain-numbing obedience, and in
return my career will inevitably flourish. That was the deal, right? </p>

<h3>People Matter</h3>

<p> And this is where I learned my first big lesson. <em>Personal relationships
are priceless.</em> Now I don't mean that "it's not what you know, it's who you
know!" bullshit -- I "know" 502 people on Facebook but that's actually
worthless. What matters more is the depth of connection, not breadth. As
a general rule, if you can't at least crash on someone's couch after a night out
on the town, well, you'll probably have a hard convincing him / her to vouch for
you in a professional setting. What's that you say? Slaving away in front of the
computer for 16 hours a day is <em>not</em> the most efficient way to
engineering success?! Nope. Get out, get some vitamin D, go to a Meetup, have
a beer if you want, laugh a little, and <em>definitely</em> make some friends.
</p>

    March 21st, 2011. First day on the job. Notice the missing belt and fake
    smile. Yep, this wasn't going to last long.

<p> Looking back on it, I think I ended up getting pretty lucky. I just
<em>happened</em> to be online at the same time as a distant colleague who just
<em>happened</em> to be looking to fill a <em>possible</em> job opening for his
co-worker <em>in Silicon Valley</em>. Needless to say, I landed the job, they
relocated me here, and here I remain. So that's when I realized, <em>people
always matter <strong>most.</strong></em>

<h3>A Year Is a Long Time</h3>

<p> I know this sounds a bit clich√©, but I arrived in California with only $86
in the bank. On top of that, I was starting to get those random $8 account
maintenance fees, where the bank charges you money for being poor. I remember
that rainy night in March I first drove into San Francisco, my car loaded with
everything I owned at the time, thinking to myself, <em>Holy shit, I'm here. My
car will probably get vandalized tonight, even if I buy nothing I'll still run
out of cash in 10 days, and I have no umbrella. But at least I'm here.</em>
Thank goodness for that credit card! </p>

<p> The good news was it could only go uphill from there. Over the next year I'd
spend my time outside work exploring the Valley, socializing, partying, and even
moving 3 times. If I had any extra time I'd spend it grokking the latest web
technologies. Now I know what you're thinking -- shouldn't I have been living
conservatively, saving money, setting strict budget goals and sticking to them?
Yeah, that's one way to go about it, and will probably work for a lot of people.
But it violates my previous conclusion that people matter <strong>most</strong>.
Consider the following scenario: It's Thursday and there's a all-day hackathon
this Saturday. However, your weekly budget doesn't permit the $65 cost to
participate. You could stick your budget, adding the $65 to your (much-needed)
financial cushion, or you could risk it and go. I say if you have <em>any</em>
development skills whatsoever, attend that hackathon fool! Chances are pretty
high that you'll meet some "idea" person who'll pay you to implement his MVP,
some technical recruiter for XYZ startup, or, best of all, a good friend and
potential co-founder. </p>

<h3>Making the Leap</h3>

<p> Fast-forward to June 2012. After hitting up enough Meetups, events, and
parties to stir rumors I was actually a homeless bum attending for the free
pizza, I finally won over enough <strike>guinea pigs</strike> clients to quit my
corporate day job and pursue crafting software full-time. For the last 6 months,
the reward I stand to gain from my work is <em>exponentially</em> tied to the
value I provide to my clients, which I like. And I get to think that, at the end
of the day, perhaps I brought someone's dreams a little closer to reality. :-)
